Introduction
============

The Reykjavík University Molecular Dynamics code for Electron Emission and Dynamics (RUMDEED) program was first written by Andreas Pedersen in Python
to simulate space charge limited photo emission :cite:p:`PhysRevLett.104.175002`. It was later rewritten in Fortran by Kristinn Torfason with parallelization using OpenMP. 
He also extended the code to include Field emission :cite:p:`doi:10.1063/1.4914855`:cite:p:`doi:10.1063/1.4972821` and
Thermal-field emission :cite:p:`PhysRevApplied.15.014040`. Laser pulse additions were added by Hákon Örn.
