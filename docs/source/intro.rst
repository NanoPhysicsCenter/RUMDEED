Introduction
============

The Vacuum-MD program was first written by Andreas Pedersen :cite:p:`PhysRevLett.104.175002` in Python
to simulate space charge limited photo emission :cite:p:`PhysRevLett.104.175002`. It was later rewritten in Fortran by Kristinn Torfason.
He also extended it to include Field emission :cite:p:`doi:10.1063/1.4914855`:cite:p:`doi:10.1063/1.4972821` and
Thermal-field emission :cite:p:`PhysRevApplied.15.014040`.
